# State Management

It's time to introduce three concepts in our React learning:

1. **Props:** Allow you to pass data into your components.
2. **Functional Components:** An alternative, and probably more intuitive approach to creating components.
3. **Controlled Components:** Allow you to hook up the forms in your application to your component state.

Before to start with our Contact app you should remove default files installed with `create-react-app` command.

### The Backend Server

The Contacts app project that we're building is a front-end project. However, we'll eventually be storing the contacts on a backend server. Since we're only really focusing on the front-end for this course, we've gone ahead and built this server for you so you can focus on just the React parts of this program.

The server is a simple Node/Express app that it is stored in the `contacts-app/reactnd-contacts-server2` path. Once you've started the server, you can forget about it. The Contacts project we're working on will interact with this server, but we won't ever modify any of the server code.

> ### Running Two Servers
> At this point, you should be running two different servers on your local machine:
> - Front-end development server: Accessible on **port 3000** (with `npm start` or `yarn start`)
> - Back-end server: Accessible on **port 5001** (with `node server.js`) Please be sure that both are running before moving on in this Lesson.

## Pass Data Into Components With Props

A good analogy to understand how works component `props` in React is with functions. Lets check:

```javascript
function fetchUser(username) {
    // ajax call
}

fetchUser('Edward');
```

The goal of the `fetchUser()` function is to fetch a specific user. Then, we have to tell the function which user to fetch. It is the reason why we pass the `username` parameter in the function definition. When the function is invoked, you have to pass the respective username.

In React, the same intuition you have about functions can also be applied to React components:

```javascript
function User extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return {
            <p>Username: {this.props.username}</p>
        }
    }
}

<User username='Edward'/>
```
The whole purpose of the `<User />` component is to display a user to the UI. Then we need a way to pass the user component a username so it knows which user to display. Then, we can add a custom attribute to our component and give it a value. In our component definition we can access to this value through `this.props.username`.

In fact, any attributes that are added to a component will be accessable on the `props` object from inside of that component.

### Pass Data With Props Recap
A `prop` is any input that you pass to a React component. Just like an HTML attribute, a `prop` name and value are added to the Component.

```javascript
// passing a prop to a component
<LogoutBytton text="Wanna log out?">
```

In the code above, `text` is the `prop` and the string `'Wanna log out?'` is the value.

All props are stored on the `this.props object`. So to access this `text prop` from _inside_ the component, we'd use `this.props.text`:

```javascript
// access the prop inside the component
...
render() {
    return <div>{this.prop.text}</div>
}
...
```

## Exercise Explanation
There are two ways to approach this app. The first is a bottom-up approach and
the second is a top-down approach.

## Bottom-Up Approach

The bottom-up approach involves two steps:
1. Putting all of our code into the `App./js` file and.
2. Once the app renders what you want it to render, you break that code up into different components. This is a possible approach to the first step of the bottom-up strategy:

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.usersByMovie = {};

    profiles.forEach(profile => {
      const movieID = profile.favoriteMovieID;

      if (this.usersByMovie[movieID]) {
        this.usersByMovie[movieID].push(profile.userID);
      } else {
        this.usersByMovie[movieID] = [profile.userID];
      }
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">ReactND - Coding Practice</h1>
        </header>
        <h1>How Popular is Your Favorite Movie?</h1>
        <ul>
          {Object.keys(movies).map(key => {
            const userIDs = this.usersByMovie[movies[key].id];

            return (
              <li key={movies[key].id}>
                <h2>{movies[key].name}</h2>
                <h3>Liked By:</h3>

                {!userIDs ? (
                  <h4>None of the current users liked this movie</h4>
                ) : (
                  ""
                )}

                <ul>
                  {userIDs &&
                    userIDs.map(userId => {
                      return (
                        <li key={userId}>
                          <p>{users[userId].name}</p>
                        </li>
                      );
                    })}
                </ul>
              </li>
            );
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

The reason we would need to do step 2 (break down that code into components) instead of just keeping it as it is above is that this code above is hard to read, harder to maintain, and impossible to reuse.

To identify the components, we would want to break up the code into sections. For example, here's a section of the code that corresponds to a particular movie:

```js
<li key={movies[key].id}>
  <h2>{movies[key].name}</h2>
  <h3>Liked By:</h3>

  {!userIDs ? <h4>None of the current users liked this movie</h4> : ""}

  <ul>
    {userIDs &&
      userIDs.map(userId => {
        return (
          <li key={userId}>
            <p>{users[userId].name}</p>
          </li>
        );
      })}
  </ul>
</li>
```

See how the `li` element represents a movie? We can replace that entire `li` chunk with:

```js
<MovieCard
  key={id}
  users={users}
  usersWhoLikedMovie={usersByMovie[id]}
  movieInfo={movies[id]}
/>
```

Now, we can use the `MovieCard` class to render our dashboard:

```js
<ul>
  {Object.keys(movies).map(id => (
    <MovieCard
      key={id}
      users={users}
      usersWhoLikedMovie={usersByMovie[id]}
      movieInfo={movies[id]}
    />
  ))}
</ul>
```

The entire chunk above can go inside our Dashboard Component.

The list of users who liked a particular movie can either reside inside of the MovieCard Component or be its own Component. In this application, it's a matter of preference because we won't be reusing the UserList Component elsewhere and the code inside of the MovieCard Component doesn't look bloated. However, if we were also required to show a list of all users in our app, we would want to reuse the UserList Component to do that.

## Top-Down Approach

Now, the top-down approach to making this app involves identifying each component first and then starting to code. We recommend practicing this approach because it will help you later in the course, when you learn about state and your apps become more complex.

An intuitive way of breaking an app into components is to draw what you want your resulting app to look like and then to physically draw boxes around each piece of our application - take a look at this article to see an example of that: https://brotzky.co/blog/react-thinking-in-components.

### How to Know What should be a Component:

Components are reusable chunks that can be nested inside of each other, like Russian nesting dolls. Each component needs to follow the Single Responsibility Principle - that is, do only 1 thing.

Oftentimes, the number of components an app should have is subjective, but it is always the case that they should follow the Single Responsibility Principle, be reusable, and manageable in size.

## Functional components
Until this point, we have used JavaScript class syntax with a render method to build out our components. Eventually, we'll be adding more methods to these classes, but for now, it's good to know that if all your components have a render method you can  use a regular old function to create your component.

> If a component is only using a `render()` method to display content, then it can be converted into a _Stateless Functional Component_.

Notice however, that we are no longer accessing the component's props by using `this` keyword. Instead, our functional component is being passed it's props as the first argument to the functions.

```js
function User(props) {
  return (
    <p>Username: {props.username}</p>
  )
}
```

### Stateless Functional Components Recap
If your component does not keep track of internal state (i.e., all it has is a `render()` method), you cand delcare the component as _Stateless Functional Component_.

Remember that a React component is a JavaScript function that returns HTML for rendering. As such, the following two example of a simple Email component are equivalent:

```js
class Email extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.text}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

```js
const Email = (props) => (
  <div>
    {props.text}
  </div>
);
```

In the latter example (written as an ES6 function with an implicit return), rather than accessing `props` from `this.props`, we can pass in props directly as an argument to the function itself. In turn, this regular JavaScript function can serve as the Email component's `render()` method.

## Add State To A Component

At this point you're learned:

- Creating Components
- Composing Components Together
- Passing Data to Components

However, we still have not talked about what may be the best part of React, **State Management.** Because of React's component model, we are able to encapsulate the complexity of the state management to individual components. This allow us to build a large application by building out a bunch of smaller applications -really, components–.

### State
We learned that `props` refer to attributes from parent components. In the end, props represent "read-only" data that are _immutable_.

A component's `state`, on the other hand, represents _mutable_ data that ultimately affects what is rendered on the page. State is managed internally by the component itself and is meant to change over time, commonly due to user input (e.g., clicking on a button on the page).

To encapsulate the complexity of state management to individual components, we have to add a `state` object inside the class _...not_ in the `constructor()`, to follow the [class field proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields):

```js
class User extends React.Component {
  state = {
    username: 'Tyler'
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <p>Username: {this.state.username}</p>
    )
  }
}
```

### (Warning) Props in Initial State
When defining a component's initial state, avoid initializing that state with `props`. This is an error-prone _anti-pattern_, since state will only be initialized with `props` when the component is first created.

```js
state = {
    username: props.user // anti-pattern
}
```

In the above example, if `props` are ever updated, the current state will not change unless the component is "refreshed." Using `props` to produce a component's initial state also leads to duplication of data, deviating from a dependable "source of truth."

> State is a key property of React components. Being familiar with how state is used and how state is set (and reset) will help streamline building the UI of your app.

> In our `contacts-app` example, the contacts array should be part of the `state` object because we can add or remove contact from our contacts array.

### State Recap
By having a component manage its own state, any time there are changes made to that state, React will know and _automatically_ make the necessary updates to the page.

This is one of the key benefits of using React to build UI components: when it comes to re-rendering the page, we just have to think about updating state. We don't have to keep track of exactly which parts of the page change each time there are updates. We don't need to decide how we will efficiently re-render the page. React compares the previous output and new output, determines what has changed, and makes these decisions for us. This process of determining what has changed in the previous and new outputs is called `Reconciliation`.
